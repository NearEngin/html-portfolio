<h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    Hey there! I'm <strong>Niranjan K S</strong> — an Electronics Engineering student with a knack for turning ideas into reality through code and creativity. I'm all about building cool stuff, whether it's wiring up circuits or crafting responsive websites.
  </p>
  <p>
    I started my journey with electronics, but soon realized I enjoy the fusion of hardware and software. That led me into Python, web development, and tech experiments that blend logic and aesthetics. I love projects that challenge me to learn something new and leave room for creativity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Right now, I’m diving deeper into full-stack development, learning modern tools and frameworks, and working on side projects to sharpen my skills. I believe in learning by doing, failing forward, and staying curious.

    Outside the screen, you might find me sketching out ideas, brainstorming wild project concepts, or just obsessing over how things work. Always down to collaborate, learn, or build something awesome.
